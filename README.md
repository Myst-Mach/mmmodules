## 3mountains:
  A simple monophonic 3xosc module with morphing waveshapes
  
  ### Controls for each oscillator:
    * Tune: For adjusting the pitch in large amounts
    
    * Mod: For modulating the pitch with an external lfo, knob adjusts the amount of modulation
    
    * Fine: For adjusting the pitch in small amounts
    
    * PWM: For pulsewidth/morph modulation via external lfo, knob adjusts the amount of modulation similar to the Mod section
    
    * 1v/oct: For 1 volt per octave signals i.e. keyboard & sequencer signals
    
    * Pulse: Pulsewidth: For setting a fixed pulsewidth/morph position, with pwm added this position becomes the middlepoint
             & the modulation added will go from side to side of it by the amount set by the pwm knob
             
    * Sine: For producing a sine wave, adjusting the pulse knob morphs the wave from a sine to a triangle wave
    
    * Triangle: For producing a triangle wave, adjusting the pulse knob morphs the wave from a triangle to a saw wave
    
    * Saw: For producing a saw wave, adjusting the pulse knob morphs the wave from a saw to a square wave
    
    * Square: For producing a square wave, adjusting the pulse knob changes the pulsewidth of the wave

  
** Feedback & suggestions are much appreciated, this is an on/off hobby project of mine to learn c++ so things may be a bit rough around the edges, thanx <3 **
